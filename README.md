## Project Scope

The "Animated-Decision-Tree-And-Random-Forest" project aims to develop an application that provides visualization and explanations for the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms. The primary focus is on creating engaging and informative visualizations using the Python Manim library.

## Features:

### Algorithm Visualization:

Animated representations of the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.
Clear and intuitive visuals to aid in understanding the decision-making process.


### Manim Library Integration

Utilization of the Manim library to generate high-quality mathematical animations.
Visually appealing and dynamic presentations to enhance the learning experience.


### Potential CLI Integration:

Future consideration for a command-line interface (CLI) to enable users to interact with the tool.
Users can import their own datasets, and the corresponding decision trees and random forests will be visualized.
Educational Purpose:

Designed with the intention of serving as an educational tool for individuals learning about machine learning algorithms.
Explanation of key concepts and steps involved in Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.
